				<h1>Ways to Give</h1>
		<p>At Families in Transition, we believe in the strength of families. Just as family members can look to each other in times of difficulty, we believe that every man, woman, and child deserves to feel safe and supported. When we welcome participants to Families in Transition, they donâ€™t just enter a program. They join an incredible network of staff, volunteers, participants, alumni, donors, and others that provide the support necessary for success.</p>
<h2>Join our family today.</h2>
<p>There are many ways for you to make a difference in the lives of our participants. We are deeply grateful and thank you for your generosity and continued support.<br />
